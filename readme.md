# T-Octree voxel data compression library

This *Tucker-Octree* (T-Octree) library compresses 3-dimensional dense datasets
using octree multiresolution approach with Tucker decomposition. The collected
core and factor matrices are further compressed with the ZFP library.

## Installation

Typical cmake installation:

```bash
> mkdir build; cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEigen3_DIR="path/to/share/eigen3/cmake" -Dzfp_DIR="path/to/lib/cmake/zfp" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<vlasiator-path>/vdf_compression"
> make install
```

After that add `-Lpath/to/vdf_compression/lib` to linker flags and
`-Ipath/to/vdf_compression/include` to compiler flags for vlasiator.

## Licensing

T-Octree is licensed under GPL2.0 or later (see `LICENSE` text).
